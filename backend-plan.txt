Smart Waste Pickup Scheduler Backend Implementation Plan

Information Gathered:
- Backend to be implemented in Java using Spring Boot.
- Use MySQL for user/auth data.
- Use MongoDB for pickup schedules and history.
- Microservices architecture:
  - Auth Service: JWT-based login for users and city workers.
  - Pickup Management Service: schedule garbage pickup (location, type, time slot).
  - Admin Scheduling Service: view pickup schedules, assign trucks.
  - Notification Service: send reminders and confirmations (mocked).
- Dockerize services and provide Swagger docs.
- Async email notifications (RabbitMQ/Kafka optional).

Plan:
1. Setup Spring Boot projects for each microservice:
   - auth-service
   - pickup-service
   - admin-service
   - notification-service
2. Common modules for shared utilities (e.g., JWT utils).
3. Auth Service:
   - User entity in MySQL.
   - JWT authentication and authorization.
   - REST APIs for login and user management.
4. Pickup Service:
   - MongoDB integration.
   - REST APIs for scheduling pickups.
5. Admin Service:
   - APIs to view and assign pickups.
6. Notification Service:
   - Mock email/SMS notifications.
7. Dockerize each service with Dockerfile.
8. Provide Swagger API documentation.
9. Optional: Integrate RabbitMQ/Kafka for async notifications.

Dependent Files to be created:
- Separate Spring Boot projects for each microservice with respective source files.
- Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for orchestration.

Follow-up Steps:
- Implement each microservice step-by-step.
- Test APIs with Postman or Swagger UI.
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this backend implementation plan.
